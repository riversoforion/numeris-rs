*TODO: CI, Cargo, Docs.rs links*

The Rust implementation of Numeris features a library and CLI.

## Library Usage

*TODO: See the Docs.rs site*

## Command Line Usage

*TODO*

## Development

Numeris is a simple Rust package, built on Rust's standard tooling and
ecosystem. It should be relatively easy for even a novice Rust developer (like
me!) to understand and modify.
